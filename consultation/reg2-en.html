  <h4 class="bold">Executive summary </h4>
  <div class="textBoxBlackBorder">
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Issues:</strong> The<em> Budget Implementation Act, 2016, No. 1</em>, which received royal assent on June 22, 2016, contains amendments to the <em>Employment Insurance Act</em> (EI Act) to reduce the employment insurance (EI) waiting period from two weeks to one week. In Budget 2016, the Government of Canada announced that the reduction of the waiting period would be effective on January 1, 2017. Consequential amendments to the <em>Employment Insurance Regulations</em> (EI Regulations) are required to align the regulatory provisions with the amendments made to the EI Act.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;">The change to the EI waiting period may impact some employers who offer benefit plans where they interact with the EI program: (1) in the standards for participation in the EI Premium Reduction Program (PRP); and (2) in the treatment of payments by employers under benefit plans that supplement an employee’s EI benefits. Amendments to the EI Regulations are required to mitigate the impact of the reduction of the waiting period on these plans and employees.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Description:</strong> Consequential amendments to the EI Regulations are required to align references to the waiting period in the EI Regulations with a one-week waiting period in the EI Act.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;">In the proposed Regulations, the requirement relating to the elimination period for the PRP would be amended to reduce the maximum elimination period from 14 consecutive days to 7, to align with the one-week waiting period. As a mitigation measure, a transitional provision would be provided in the EI Regulations to allow affected employers to continue to qualify for participation in the PRP for a period of up to four years. This transitional provision would be repealed on January 3, 2021. Departmental communications planning would take into account the need to contact and remind key stakeholders in advance of the repeal of all transitional measures.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;">To mitigate the potential impact of the change in the waiting period on employees and their employers where employers provide benefit plans that supplement a claimant’s EI benefits, transitional provisions would be provided in the EI Regulations. These provisions would increase, for a period of four years, the maximum amount of combined employer and EI payments that claimants may receive in the week following the one-week waiting period without reducing their EI benefits. These transitional provisions would also be repealed on January 3, 2021.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>Cost-benefit statement:</strong> Based on an assessment of the impact on stakeholders, the overall net benefit to affected employers, their employees and the Government of Canada would be zero in relation to the PRP over a 10-year period. The cost for affected employers is estimated to be $4.6 million on an annualized average basis. Employers would receive an equivalent amount in the form of premium reductions and would be required to share $1.9 million on an annualized basis with employees.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;"><strong>“One-for-One” Rule and small business lens: </strong>Employers that choose to update their plans would be required to resubmit their adjusted plan to remain in the PRP. However, the “One-for-One” Rule does not apply as the PRP is a voluntary program.<br />
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:6pt;">The total cost savings of the flexible option (the recommended option) relative to the initial option (no transitional provision) for small businesses are estimated to be up to $940 per small business, and $3.6 million overall, on an annualized average basis.<br />

 <h4 class="bold">Background</h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">In Budget 2016, the Government of Canada announced several initiatives to improve employment insurance (EI), including reducing the EI waiting period from two weeks to one week.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">The EI waiting period is defined in the <em>Employment Insurance Act</em> (EI Act) and is referenced throughout the EI Act and the <em>Employment Insurance Regulations</em> (EI Regulations). Pursuant to the EI Act, the EI waiting period is a period of time that must be served before a claimant is entitled to be paid EI benefits. The waiting period has been a key feature of the EI program since its inception and serves as a deductible similar to private insurance. It has been set at two weeks since 1971 and applies to regular, fishing, special and self-employed benefits.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">The <em>Budget Implementation Act, 2016, No. 1</em> contains amendments to the EI Act that reduce the EI waiting period from two weeks to one week. The Government of Canada announced in Budget 2016 that the reduction of the waiting period would take effect on January 1, 2017.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Reducing the waiting period will ease financial pressure at the front end of a claim when EI-eligible individuals become unemployed or leave work temporarily due to health or family pressures and could help claimants defray expenses as they adjust to the income shock in these circumstances. For example, for an eligible claimant who is laid off and subsequently finds work after 12 weeks, up to 11 weeks of EI benefits will be payable whereas only up to 10 weeks are currently payable. This results in an estimated fiscal cost of $650 million per year.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Employer benefit packages play an important role in supporting workers, which is recognized under the EI program.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Premium Reduction Program</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">The PRP provides a reduction of the employer’s premium rate when an employer provides a plan in respect of illness or injury to their employees that meets the standards established in the EI Regulations. A requirement of the EI Regulations is that the premium reduction be shared between employers and employees in portions of 7/12 and 5/12, respectively. The premium reduction recognizes the savings to the EI Operating Account resulting from workers utilizing employer benefits before accessing EI sickness benefits. To qualify under the PRP, a plan must meet the requirement under paragraph 63(b) of the EI Regulations, which states that where plans have an elimination period (analogous to the EI waiting period), it shall not exceed 14 consecutive days, starting with the first day of the period of incapacity. This is in line with the current EI waiting period of two weeks. To align this requirement with the change to a one-week waiting period under the EI Act, amendments to the EI Regulations are required to reduce the maximum elimination period of an employer plan from the current 14 consecutive days to 7 consecutive days.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Employer supplementary benefit plans</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">(a)	Supplementary unemployment benefit plans</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Pursuant to section 37 of the EI Regulations, supplementary unemployment benefit (SUB) plans are provided by employers to provide supplementary income to workers in addition to EI payments during periods of unemployment due to a temporary stoppage of work, training (including for apprentices), illness, injury or quarantine. Payments received by an EI claimant under a SUB plan are not considered earnings and, therefore, do not result in a reduction of EI benefits. To qualify as a SUB plan, paragraph 37(2)(d) of the EI Regulations states that the plan must require that the combination of the weekly payments received from the plan and the portion of the claimant’s EI weekly benefit rate from that employment do not exceed 95% of the employee’s normal weekly earnings from that employment.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">(b)	Maternity leave, leave for the care of a child and compassionate care leave plans</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Under section 38 of the EI Regulations, a second category of employer supplementary benefit plans is composed of plans provided by employers to cover periods of leave because of pregnancy, for the care of a newborn or newly adopted child or for the care or support of a gravely ill family member or critically ill child. Pursuant to subsection 38(1) of the EI Regulations, payments from these plans are treated in a manner similar to SUB plans, namely that they are not considered as earnings and, therefore, do not reduce EI benefits.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Subsection 38(1) of the EI Regulations states that the payments received by claimants are excluded as earnings as long as, when combined with the portion of the claimant’s EI weekly benefit rate from employment, they do not exceed the claimant’s normal weekly earnings from that employment.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Issues</h4>
  <h5 class="underline">Premium Reduction Program</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">According to Statistics Canada, there were approximately 1.17 million employer businesses in Canada in December 2015. The 2015 Actuarial Report estimated that 30 800 employers had plans that qualified for participation under the PRP. The vast majority of employers would not be affected by the proposed amendments to the EI Regulations, which would reduce the maximum elimination period from 14 consecutive days to 7 consecutive days, since they already provide for an elimination period of 7 days or less. However, administrative data indicate that approximately 4 700 employers with plans under the PRP have an elimination period of more than 7 days. There would be, therefore, a group of employers who may not meet the proposed new standard when it comes into effect. This group represents approximately 15% of employers participating in the PRP and 0.4% of all employers.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">As some PRP plans take the EI two-week waiting period into account in their design and some are embedded in collective agreements or agreements with third party insurance providers, it may not be easy for these employers to make adjustments to their plans in the short to medium term.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Employer supplementary benefit plans</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">Under the current EI Regulations, the change to a one-week waiting period could result, for some EI claimants, in a combined payment of employer and EI benefits that exceeds the maximum allowable amount in the week following the one-week waiting period, either in regard to employer payments under a SUB (section 37 of the EI Regulations) or under the aforementioned second category of employer supplementary benefit plans (section 38 of the EI Regulations). In other cases, while claimants would still be entitled to the same maximum number of weeks of EI benefit, they could potentially receive one less week of employer benefits. The impact of the change in the EI waiting period on claimants covered by an employer supplementary benefit plan would depend on the specific nature of the existing employer plans, which are often also outlined in collective agreements, as well as the actions of employers in response to the change in the waiting period, both in the immediate term and over the longer term.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Objectives</h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">The objectives of the proposed amendments to the EI Regulations are to</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Align the references to the waiting period in the EI Regulations with the one-week waiting period in the EI Act;</li>
    <li>Align the elimination period requirement to qualify for the PRP with a one-week EI waiting period;</li>
    <li>Provide employers who have an existing PRP plan a transitional period of four years within which to adjust their plan to meet the new PRP requirement, while continuing to receive a premium reduction; and</li>
    <li>Provide employers who have an existing employer supplementary benefit plan a transitional period of four years within which to adjust their plan while minimizing the impact on their employees.</li>
  </ul>
 <h4 class="bold">Description </h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">Consequential amendments to sections 39 and 46 are proposed to align references to the waiting period in the EI Regulations with a one-week waiting period in the EI Act.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Premium Reduction Program</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">The PRP standards in the EI Regulations would be amended to state that the maximum elimination period in an employer plan cannot exceed 7 consecutive days, instead of the current 14 consecutive days.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">A transitional provision would be provided in the EI Regulations to allow existing PRP plans that may not meet the new requirement regarding the elimination period to continue to qualify as a plan under the PRP for a period of four years. This transitional provision would provide employers who are affected by the change with a reasonable period within which to update their plans to meet the new standard, should they wish to do so, while continuing to receive a premium reduction during the transitional period. This transitional provision would be repealed on January 3, 2021.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Employer supplementary benefit plans</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">In the case of SUB plans, a transitional provision would be added to section 37 of the EI Regulations that would allow the application of plans that were in place prior to the coming into force of the proposed amendments to result in a combined payment of employer and EI benefits that exceeds 95% of the employee’s normal weekly earnings for the week following the one-week waiting period. This would mitigate the impact of the reduction of the waiting period on claimants’ EI benefits and allow these plans to continue to qualify as SUBs for a period of time while providing employers time to adjust to the reality of a one-week waiting period. This transitional provision would be repealed on January 3, 2021.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">In the case of the second category of employer supplementary benefit plans, a transitional provision would be added to section 38 of the EI Regulations to increase, for plans that were in place prior to the coming into force of the proposed amendments, the maximum amount of combined employer payments and EI benefits that claimants may receive in the week following the one-week waiting period such that EI benefits would not be reduced if the combined payments exceed the current allowable limit. Thus, it would mitigate the potential impact of the reduction of the EI waiting period on employers and their employees, and provide employers with a period of time to adjust their plans, should they choose to do so. This transitional provision would be repealed on January 3, 2021.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Regulatory and non-regulatory options considered </h4>
  <h5 class="underline">Premium Reduction Program</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">The PRP is a voluntary program with standards for participation in the program that are set out in the EI Regulations. As a result, any changes to these standards must be made through regulatory amendments. The premium reduction is estimated to be approximately $900 million per year. Of this amount, it is estimated that affected employers currently receive approximately 11%, or $99 million, in premium reductions.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">A non-regulatory alternative that would maintain the status quo in the EI regulations was considered. However, it was determined that this option was not viable since it would result in a misalignment between a legislated one-week waiting period and the current PRP requirement that the elimination period not exceed 14 consecutive days, which is designed to be aligned with a two-week waiting period. If this standard were not adjusted to align with a one-week EI waiting period, employers with plans that exceed a seven-day elimination period would continue to receive a premium reduction, while their employees, if EI-eligible, could claim a week of EI sickness benefits prior to employer benefits becoming payable, on an ongoing basis. As a result, expected savings to the EI Operating Account would not be fully realized.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Given the proposed amendment to shorten the elimination period standard, a key consideration was the minimization of potential adverse impacts. If the elimination period standard were amended but a transitional measure were not provided, an estimated 4 700 employers who would not meet the new standard as of January 1, 2017, would no longer qualify to participate in the PRP and would cease to benefit from a premium reduction. This could represent a significant cost, estimated at approximately $99 million per year in the form of a foregone premium reduction.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">In addition, misalignment between the EI waiting period and the elimination period standard for qualifying PRP plans would result in administrative inefficiency and complexity that would impact affected employers and their employees as well as the Government of Canada. Employees claiming one week of EI benefits prior to employer benefits becoming payable would need to apply to the EI program. Employers would need to provide a Record of Employment (ROE) to support a claim for one week of EI benefits and the Government of Canada would need to process these additional claims, none of which would occur if the EI waiting period and elimination period were aligned. In the event that the employee remained unable to work upon exhaustion of employer benefits, he or she could potentially renew his or her EI claim. The resulting process in which claimants alternate between EI and employer benefits is likely to be complex and confusing and to present communications challenges for all parties concerned. From an administrative perspective, the remedy is to amend the EI Regulations to align the elimination period with the one-week waiting period such that employer benefits are used and exhausted first, before EI benefits become payable. This is also in keeping with the overall policy intent of the PRP.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Employer supplementary benefit plans</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">A non-regulatory approach that would maintain the status quo was considered. However, in the absence of regulatory amendments that provide transitional provisions to mitigate the impact of the legislative change to the waiting period, some employer plans could continue to provide payments that, when combined with EI benefits, would exceed the allowable limits in the week following the waiting period, resulting in EI benefits being reduced for the employee. In addition, in the case of SUBs, the transitional provision would allow these plans to meet the regulatory standards, on an exception basis, and would therefore continue to qualify as a SUB during the transitional period.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Benefits and costs</h4>
  <h5 class="underline">Premium Reduction Program</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">Amending the requirement for the elimination period to align with a one-week waiting period would ensure that the PRP standards are consistent with the Government of Canada’s intent that employer benefits be paid before EI benefits become payable. For employers with existing plans that would not meet the new standard once it comes into force, a four-year transitional period would allow their plans to continue to qualify under the PRP during that period of time, as an exception. This would allow employers to continue to receive a premium reduction while they make adjustments to their plans, should they choose to do so.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Based on administrative data, it is estimated that roughly 4 700 employers that would otherwise no longer be eligible for the PRP would continue to receive a premium reduction for the first four years following implementation of the proposed amendments. Following the fourth year, it is assumed that these employers would align their plans with the elimination period standard (maximum seven consecutive days). The cost for these affected employers is estimated to be $4.6 million on an annualized average basis over a 10-year period. Employers would be reimbursed this total through the PRP and would be required to share 5/12 or $1.9 million on an annualized basis with employees. After accounting for the initial cost savings and subsequent reimbursement of employers, there would not be any incremental impacts on the EI Operating Account. The overall net benefit would be zero.</p>

        <h6 class="alignLeft underline">Notes</h6>
        <p class="alignLeft">Figures for affected employers, and by extension their employees, based on a sensitivity analysis in which all would choose to comply. For the purposes of this analysis, the assumed date of compliance is January 2, 2021.</p>
        <p class="alignLeft">The net cost to the EI Operating Account reflects a maximum based on affected employers waiting four years to make adjustments to their plans, and assuming that employees access sickness benefits for a week before drawing from the employer’s plan due to the reduction of the waiting period.</p> 
  <p class="alignLeft">The PRP is a voluntary program and, as such, neither obligates employers to participate nor compels them to adjust their plans in response to any amendments to standards that may affect qualifications to participate. In regard to the latter, it is recognized that the consequence for those who choose not to comply would be that they would no longer qualify for a premium reduction. Ongoing changes to standards in the EI Regulations that complement the legislative change to reduce the waiting period are restricted to the PRP standards and have been kept to a minimum to contain potential impacts on employers and their employees. That is, the only ongoing regulatory amendment specifically related to the PRP is the reduction of the maximum elimination period from 14 consecutive days to 7 consecutive days, deemed necessary to align with the legislative change that reduces the EI waiting period from two weeks to one.</p>
 <h5 class="underline">Employer supplementary benefit plans</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">There would be no additional costs to the EI Operating Account as a result of the proposed transitional provisions in the EI Regulations regarding employer supplementary benefit plans. These provisions would mitigate the risk that employees would have reduced EI benefits.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Although there are data limitations, there is some information regarding employers and employees who could benefit from the four-year transitional provisions, designed to prevent EI benefits from being reduced.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Approximately 1.9 million employees are covered by employers who provide SUB plans (section 37 of the EI Regulations). Of these, approximately 1.7 million employees (88%) have a plan that currently pays during week two of the waiting period and an estimated 204 000 employees have a SUB plan that is also linked to a collective agreement. These employees/employers are most likely to benefit from a transition period to make adjustments to align with a one-week waiting period.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Regarding the second category of employer supplementary benefit plans (section 38, EI Regulations), employers with these plans are not required to submit their plans to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC). However, it is estimated that 20% of EI maternity benefit claimants do have employers that provide a supplementary benefit plan. As there were approximately 169 000 claims for EI maternity benefits in 2014–15, an estimated 33 800 employees, and their employers, may benefit from the transitional period in a given year.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">While the maximum weeks of EI benefit entitlements would remain unchanged, it is recognized that some employees are at risk of receiving one less week of employer benefits as a result of the amendment to the EI Act that reduces the waiting period. The transitional provisions targeting affected employers, and their employees, who provide employer supplementary benefit plans is not expected to mitigate this risk.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">“One-for-One” Rule </h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">Employers that choose to update their plans would be required to resubmit their adjusted plan to remain in the PRP. However, the “One-for-One” Rule does not apply, as the PRP is a voluntary program.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Small business lens </h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">Given that the majority of employers participating in the PRP are small businesses (80%), it is expected that the majority of employers that would be impacted by this regulatory change (4<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> </span>700) would be small businesses (3<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"> </span>760). Therefore, the unique needs of small employers have been taken into account in the design of the proposed flexible approach, i.e. that includes a transitional period during which employers would be able to continue to benefit from an EI premium reduction.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">The recommended option is to provide a transitional period of four years for employers to adjust to the regulatory change. This has been done in order to provide sufficient time for all affected employers to be able to assess whether or not they would proceed with amendments to their illness or injury plans and to then take the necessary steps to do so, while continuing to benefit from EI premium reductions during the transitional period. Targeted proactive communication activities would bring attention to the upcoming changes and encourage employers, particularly those participating in the PRP (or those with employer supplementary benefit plans), to visit a Web page that would help them determine if they are impacted by the reduction of the EI waiting period.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Allowing for this transition period would have no impact on Canadians’ health, security, safety or environment. Under the initial option where the flexibility provided through transitional provisions is not available, upon the coming into force of the change impacted businesses would no longer receive premium reductions until such time as they updated their illness or injury plans, which could represent a significant cost for affected employers, and their employees, in the form of a foregone premium reduction.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Outreach activities with representatives of the small business community, in addition to large employer representatives, were held to help assess the potential impact as a result of the reduction of the waiting period. Discussions focused largely on employer plans that interact with the EI program, including the PRP and employer supplementary benefit plans. Early indications are that employers would require a period of time to more fully assess the potential impacts, and that the possibility of a transitional period to mitigate impacts and strategies for communicating the changes to employers would be well received. In addition, the Government of Canada was advised that most small employers would not be impacted by changes affecting employer supplementary benefit plans, as these plans were typically provided by larger employers with a unionized force. <a href="#footnote.55354" id="footnoteRef.55354">(see footnote 1)</a></p>
  <h5 class="italic">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Statement </h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">An amendment to the EI Regulations is proposed to align the elimination period requirement to qualify for the PRP with a one-week EI waiting period. In terms of flexibility, the alternatives are a flexible option (i.e. a four-year transitional period) versus an initial option (no transitional period).</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">In the absence of the flexible approach, employers who are not in compliance with the amended PRP standard when it becomes effective on January 1, 2017, would cease to qualify for a premium reduction at that time. The cost of non-compliance could be significant, as this group could forego an ongoing premium reduction estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars for employers and their employees.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Under an initial option where no flexibilities are offered, the costs for small businesses are estimated to be up to approximately $1,000 per small business and $3.8 million overall, on an annualized average basis. These costs would be due to the fact that affected employers would most likely not be in compliance with the amended standard when it comes into force, effective January 1, 2017. Therefore, they would no longer qualify to participate in the PRP and would forego their premium reduction. Under the flexible option, which is the recommended option, impacted small businesses would only carry costs of up to $60 per small business and $200,000 overall, on an annualized average basis. This represents savings of $940 per small business, and $3.6 million overall.</p>

 <h4 class="bold">Consultation </h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">Initial reaction to the announcement in Budget 2016 of the Government of Canada’s commitment to reduce the EI waiting period from two weeks to one was positive from employee associations and unions, including <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Unifor, Centrale des syndicats du Québec, Confédération des syndicats nationaux</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec</span>.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Employer groups were less vocal but at least one, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, did express concern regarding the potential impact on premium rates overall. Subsequently, consultations on the reduction of the EI waiting period were held via parliamentary debate as part of the tabling of the <em>Budget Implementation Act, 2016, No. 1</em> in Parliament.</p>
  <h5 class="underline">Complementary regulatory amendments</h5>
  <p class="alignLeft">Canadians, including business and groups representing employees, will have 30 days to provide comments following the publication of the proposed amendments to the EI Regulations in the <em>Canada Gazette</em>, Part I. In advance of prepublication, outreach to selected key stakeholders was undertaken by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including The Canadian Payroll Association, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association Inc. Early indicators suggest that a period of transition within which to adjust to the reduction of the waiting period would be very helpful and that communications would be a key success factor.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Rationale</h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">The <em>Budget Implementation Act, 2016, No. 1</em>, which received royal assent on June 22, 2016, contains amendments to the EI Act to reduce the employment insurance (EI) waiting period from two weeks to one week. The legislative change to the EI waiting period may impact employer benefit plans where they interact with the EI program: (1) in the standards for participation in the EI Premium Reduction Program (PRP); and (2) in the treatment of payments by employers under benefit plans that supplement an employee’s EI benefits. Therefore, amendments to the EI Regulations would be required to mitigate the impact of the reduction of the waiting period on these plans and employees.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">The Government of Canada’s objective is to align the standards in the EI Regulations regarding PRP plans with a one-week waiting period to ensure consistency with the PRP policy intent as well as to avoid administrative burden for affected employers, their employees and the Government of Canada. At the same time, there is recognition that a change in the PRP standard could affect some employers and their employees. It is the Government of Canada’s intent to provide flexibility to accommodate affected employers.</p>
 <h4 class="bold">Implementation, enforcement and service standards<br />
  </h4>
  <p class="alignLeft">A strategic communications plan has been developed to raise awareness of upcoming changes in both the legislation and regulations, provide information, including information regarding the transitional periods for some of the proposed amendments, manage expectations, and undertake outreach with key stakeholders.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Existing implementation and enforcement mechanisms contained in the ESDC’s adjudication and controls procedures will ensure that these regulatory amendments are implemented properly.</p>
  <p class="alignLeft">Regarding service standards, the proposed regulatory amendments are not expected to significantly advance ESDC’s continuing objective to reach a decision on 80% of all EI claims within 28 days (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">4</span> weeks) of the receipt of all pertinent information, as claim administration is tied to, among other things, employer information largely provided through bi-weekly payroll cycles.</p>
