	<h2 id="#a1-0">1.0 Purpose</h2>

	<p>The purpose of this guide is to provide you, the Applicant, with information about the Career Focus Program. In addition, this guide will assist you in completing and applying for funding under this program.</p>
	
	<h2 id="#a2-0">2.0 Description of the Career Focus Program</h2>

		<p>Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is one of several federal departments participating in the Career Focus Program. At AAFC, the Career Focus Program will contribute $864,000 annually to projects that employ recent graduates in agriculture, agri-food, agri-food science and veterinary medicine. Each project will be eligible to receive up to $20,000 in matching funds. The program will help create some 80 agricultural internships for recent graduates of a qualified post-secondary program.</p> 
	
		<h3 id="#a2-1">2.1 Duration</h3>

		<p>Each internship may last up to 12 months. The minimum duration is four months, but internships must last long enough to provide meaningful experience to the employee.  </p>
		
		<h3 id="#a2-2">2.2 Eligible applicants</h3>
		
		<p>Eligible Applicants must be legal entities capable of entering into legally binding agreements.</p> 
		
		<h4>Eligible employers</h4>

		<p>Eligible employers are organizations who can offer projects that will give employees:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>agriculture career-related work experiences in Canada; and</li>
		<li>skills acquisition through mentoring and coaching.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>These organizations may be from:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>industry;</li>
		<li>not-for-profit organizations;</li>
		<li>provincial and municipal governments;</li>
		<li>associations;</li>
		<li>boards;</li>

		<li>a provincial program focusing on biological, agricultural and veterinary science or applied technology; and</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Canadian citizen or permanent resident.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Eligible projects</h4>

		<p>Projects must offer the employee meaningful work (internship) that may last up to one year and be for a minimum of four months. The project must last long enough to give the employee significant experience and possibly lead to long-term employment or self-employment.</p> 

		<h3 id="#a2-3">2.3 Maximum funding amount</h3>

		<p>Each project will be eligible to receive up to $20,000 in matching funds.</p>  

		<h3 id="#a2-4">2.4 Application intake</h3>

		<p>The program will be accepting applications between November 1 and November 30 each year for projects beginning on or after the following April. </p>

		<h3 id="#a2-5">2.5 Eligible activities</h3>

		<p>Eligible activities include those of an approved project which may improve the intern's employability in the agricultural field. </p> 

		<h3 id="#a2-6">2.6 Eligible costs</h3>

		<p>Career Focus Program funds may only be allocated for salaries and social benefits. The employer is responsible for paying the employee. </p> 

		<h3 id="#a2-7">2.7 Ineligible costs or limitations</h3>

		<p>The Career Focus Program only supports salaries and benefits for qualified interns. </p>

		<p>Because of the demand for internships, applicants will be limited to one application per round until all eligible applications have been assessed. If funds exist to support more than one application per applicant, additional applications will be considered. </p>

	<h2 id="#a3-0">3.0 How to apply</h2>

		<p>Please note that the submission of an application creates no obligation on the part of AAFC to provide funding for the proposed project. As an Applicant, you must ensure that you meet all eligibility criteria before submitting your application. </p> 

		<h4>Online</h4>

		<p>AAFC offers you the ability to <a href="service-aafc-en.html">apply online</a>, simplifying the application process and making it faster and easier for your information to get to us. The online application form is a dynamic form. A complete online application package consists of a completed AAFC Online Career Focus Application Form. </p>

		<h4>Fax/Mail or email</h4>

		<p>For those applying by fax/mail or email, please see the contact information provided in section 6 to obtain your Application Form. </p>

		<p>A complete hard copy application package consists of a completed AAFC Career Focus Application Form. 

		<h4>Confidentiality</h4>

		<p>It is the Applicant's responsibility to clearly identify, on any documentation submitted to AAFC, the information that is considered commercially confidential. This information will not be disclosed unless required by law, including the <cite>Access to Information Act</cite>, or upon the express authorization of the applicant. </p>

	<h2 id="#a4-0">4.0 Assessment and approval</h2>

		<h3 id="#a4-1">4.1 Assessment criteria</h3>

		<p>The responsible officers in the Canadian Agri-Staff Services regional offices will evaluate proposals to determine the merit of projects. If a project is selected, the applicant will be contacted and required to sign a contribution agreement with AAFC. </p>

		<h3 id="#a4-2">4.2 Contribution agreement</h3>

		<p>Successful Applicants who enter into a Contribution Agreement (CA) with AAFC will be referred to therein as Recipients. Recipients are required to enter into a CA that outlines the amount of funding AAFC will provide to the Recipient toward eligible costs, as well as the Recipient's responsibilities and obligations. </p> 

			<h4>4.2.1 Payments to Recipients</h4>

			<p>AAFC will make payments based on claims submitted for eligible costs incurred and paid by the Recipient in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CA. Each claim must be supported by details of the costs being claimed and certified by an authorized official of the Recipient.</p> 

			<p>For projects of less than eight months, AAFC will issue 100% of funds at the end of the internship, upon receipt of the final report, proof of salary payment to the candidate, and Financial Engagement form.</p> 

			<p>For projects of eight to 12 months AAFC will issue 50% of funds after the first half of the internship, only upon receipt of the Financial Engagement form and proof of salary payment to the candidate. The payment of the last 50% is made at the end of the internship, upon receipt of the final report, the Financial Commitment form and proof of salary payment to the candidate. </p>

			<p>Career Focus Program funds may only be allocated for salaries and social benefits. The employer is responsible for paying the employee. </p>

		<h3 id="#a4-3">4.3 Reporting requirements</h3>

		<p>The Employer is responsible for completing and submitting to AAFC the required documents and evaluation reports at the mid-point and/or at the end of the Project and to participate in program evaluation by AAFC which could occur after 12 months and 36 months. </p> 

		<p>See the Resources for evaluation and participant information <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/?id=1410898589067">forms</a>.</p> 

	<h2 id="#a5-0">5.0 Notes</h2>

		<h3 id="#a5-1">5.1 Official languages</h3>

			<h4>5.1.1 Language of service</h4>

			<p>Applicants and Recipients are encouraged to communicate with AAFC in the official language of their choice. AAFC reviews and assesses applications and project deliverables in both official languages.</p>  

			<h4>5.1.2 Language obligations of recipients</h4>

			<p>Depending on the nature of the program, the type of Recipient, and specific project activities to be undertaken, the Government of Canada may require the Recipient to make information available to and interact with the public in one or both official languages on terms and conditions to be specified in the Contribution Agreement. </p>

			<p>In all cases the Recipient must publicly acknowledge AAFC's support for the project and project-specific communications products. The department may request that such acknowledgment include text in both official languages. Contribution funding from the Career Focus Program can be used to help cover the cost of conducting activities and communicating with the public in Canada's official languages as long as the costs fall within the definition of eligible costs and are included within the project budget. </p> 

		<h3 id="#a5-2">5.2 M-30 Law (for Quebec organizations only)</h3>

		<p>The <cite>Act Respecting the Ministère du Conseil Exécutif</cite> (M-30) may apply to an applicant in the Province of Québec. Applicants will be required to complete an additional information form and, if they are subject to the requirements of the Act, to obtain written authorization and approval from the Government of Quebec prior to execution of any contribution funding agreement. </p>

		<h3 id="#a5-3">5.3 Privacy notice</h3>

In addition, the information may be used for program evaluation, reporting to senior management and statistical analysis. </p>

		<p>The personal information will be protected in accordance with the <cite>Privacy Act</cite> and described in standard <a href="http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/offices-and-locations/access-to-information-and-privacy-services/info-source-2016/?id=1347308413430">AAFC Personal Information Bank PPU 300</a> (Career Focus Program/Agricultural Youth Green Jobs Initiative).

		<h3 id="#a5-5">5.5 Environmental considerations</h3>

		<p>All projects receiving funding from AAFC must comply with the <cite>Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012</cite> (CEAA 2012).

If you do not know, indicate that this information is "unknown."</p> 

		<p>The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will consider whether your project requires an environmental determination under section 67 of the CEAA 2012 and take the necessary steps if a determination is required and may inform you accordingly. </p>

		<p>Provide details on any environmental risks in the "Risk Assessment" section in the Application Form, which includes confirming whether you have or will obtain federal, provincial, territorial or municipal authorizations and permits. AAFC reserves the right to request additional information.</p>
