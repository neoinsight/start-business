<h1>Choosing a name for your business</h1>

<p >Choosing a name for your business isn’t
something to rush into. There are several factors to consider from both a legal
and marketing perspective. </p>

<h2>On this page</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#_Step_1:_How">Choose a good name</a></li>

<li><a href="#_Step_2:_Find">Find out if a
name is already taken</a></li>

<li><a href="#_Step_3:_Learn">Register your business name </a></li>

<li><a href="#glossary">Glossary</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Step_1:_How"></a>1. How to choose a good
name</h2>

<p >Keep these things in mind when choosing a
name for your business: </p>

<p>
<b>Does it describe the product or service you
offer?</b><br />
Be clear about
the product or service you offer. Otherwise, you may create confusion and give
people the wrong impression about your business. </p>

<p>
<b>Does it reflect the values of your business? </b><br />
Think about how
you want your business to be perceived. </p>

<p><b>Can customers identify and remember it? </b><br />
Names that are
easy to pronounce and spell will help customers remember you. Just because a
name has personal significance to you doesn’t mean that it will resonate with
your customers. </p>

<p><b>Is the name distinctive?</b><br />
Your business
name should be unique and distinctive. For both legal and marketing reasons,
you need to avoid duplication or confusion with existing business names and
trademarks. </p>

<h2><a name="_Step_2:_Find"></a>2. Find out if a name is
already taken</h2>

<p >In most cases, if someone is already using a
name, you cannot legally use it. By law, the name of your business can't be the
same as or very similar to an existing corporate name or trade-mark. Even when it
is legal to use an existing business name, it can be a disastrous marketing
mistake. </p>

<p >There are a few places you should check to
see whether a name is taken. </p>

<h3>1. Search the Internet</h3>

<p >The easiest way to check if someone
else is already using your proposed name is to search the Web. This will give
you an idea of who else is using the same name or a similar name. You may also want
to check whether the Internet domain name and social media handles you want to
use are already taken. If you plan to do business in other countries, check
whether anyone is using the name in those countries too. </p>

<h3>2. Canadian corporate names (except Quebec) and trademarks database - Nuans</h3>

<p >Using the Nuans database, you can
search Canadian and provincial/territorial corporate names, as well as
trademarks. This includes:</p>

<p>
<b>Names of federal corporations (CD) and
trademarks (TM). </b> These both give a company
exclusive rights to their use across Canada. </p>

<p><b>Names of provincial/territorial corporations (except
Quebec). </b> This includes companies that are
incorporated in a province or territory or extra-provincial/extra-territorial
corporations that have registered in a specific province or territory. In both
cases, these companies have exclusive rights to the name in that jurisdiction. </p>

<p >You can search
your proposed name(s) for free with Nuans to find out if it is in use or not.
However, you will need to pay to obtain a report to submit for name approval as
a federal corporation. 
</p>

<li><a href="https://www.nuans.com/auth/app/scr/corp/nuans/public/PreSearch.html?lang=eng">Search
Canadian corporate names (except Quebec) and trademarks - Nuans </a></li></ul>

<h3>3. Business Registry Search (Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec)</h3>

<p>Use this free database
to search for businesses that are incorporated federally, incorporated
provincially or registered provincially in the provinces of Nova Scotia,
Ontario and Quebec. </p>

<p>For each match
found, you can view details on where the company is registered and the type of
company it is. In most cases, if a corporation has the name you plan to use,
you cannot use it. However, if another type of company (for example, a sole
proprietorship or partnership) has registered the name as a trade name, you may
be able to use it. </p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/ccbr/search-chercher?lang=eng">Business
Registry Search (Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec)</a></li></ul>

<h3>4. Other provinces and territories. </h3>

<p  >For all other
provinces and territories, you can search their individual databases to see
whether a trade name is in use. Registering a trade name does not give a
company exclusive rights to use that name. However, it may not be a good idea
from a marketing perspective. </p>

<p  >Use these links
to search the provincial and territorial databases. Some are fee-based services and not all of them can be searched online. </p>

<h2><a name="_Step_3:_Learn"></a>Register your business name</h2>

<p >Most businesses need to register their
business name with the government. In this section, you’ll learn about the
different types of names your business could have and how to register them. Before
registering your business name, it is important to <a
href="http://www.canadabusiness.ca/starting/before-starting-your-business/corporation-partnership-or-sole-proprietorship/">decide what structure to use for your business (sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation)</a>. </p>


<h3>When do you need to register a business name</h3>

<p >If you are a sole proprietor operating a
business under your legal name (for example, Jane Doe), you generally do not need to
register your business name. </p>

<p >In all other scenarios, you will need to
register your name either as your legal corporate name or a trade name. You may
also wish to register a trademark. </p>

<h3>Corporate names</h3>

<p >If you are planning to incorporate your
business, the process of incorporating includes name registration within the
jurisdiction where you are incorporating. </p>

<p>
If you incorporate federally, you will have
exclusive use of your corporate name across the country. See <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/h_cs02079.html">naming your
federal corporation</a> or 
<a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/eng/cs06939.html">start the
incorporation process online</a>.</p>

<p>
If you are incorporating provincially or
territorially, you have exclusive use of your corporate name in the province or
territory where you incorporate. </p>

<h3>Registering a trade name (operating name) other than your
legal name</h3>

<p >If you want to use a name other than your
business’ legal name, you will need to register it as a trade name. Failing to
register a name that you are using can result in significant fines and other
legal consequences.</p>

<p >Some examples of businesses that need to
register a trade name include: </p>

<ul>

<li>you are a sole proprietor but are adding
something to your legal name that modifies it (for example,  Jane Doe Consulting)</li>

<li>
you plan to use a name other than your legal
name for marketing purposes (for example, your company’s legal name is Smith Bakeries
Inc., but you are marketing as Bob Smith’s Bakery)</li>
</ul>

<p>Registration of trade names is a
provincial/territorial responsibility. Go to the registries of the jurisdiction(s)
where you plan to do business to learn about registering your trade name. </p>

</ul>

<p >In <b>Newfoundland and Labrador</b> there
is no registration of trade names. Registration is only required for
corporations and cooperatives. </p>

<h3>Registering a trademark</h3>

<p >Even if your company name or your business
name is registered federally (Corporations Canada), provincially or
territorially, it is recommended to also obtain trademark registration to
better protect your brand.</p>

<p>Advantages of registering a trademark: </p>
<ul>
<li>
the registration provides proof of ownership</li>

<li>
it provides you with exclusive rights across
Canada for 15 years and may be renewed indefinitely</li>

<li>
it helps you protect your products and services
from imitation and misuse</li>

<li>
it allows you to flag an infringement under the
Trade-marks Act</li>

<li>
it provides you with licensing opportunities to
maximize your trademark’s commercial potential</li>

<li>
it protects your trademark’s value</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Operating name and trade name</dt>

<dd>Your operating name is the name you use in
your day-to-day activities and to advertise your business. For some businesses,
this is the same as their legal name. Other businesses may choose to register a
trade name that is different from their legal name. </dd>

<dt>Corporation</dt>

<dd>A corporation is a legal entity that is
separate from its shareholders. As a shareholder of a corporation, you will not
be personally liable for the debts, obligations or acts of the corporation.
Businesses can incorporate federally or in a specific province/territory. </dd>

<dt>Extra-provincial or extra-territorial
corporation </dt>

<dd>An extra-provincial or extra-territorial
corporation is a corporation registered within one jurisdiction in Canada but
doing business in another. Provincial and territorial legislation require a
corporation to register as an extra-provincial or extra-territorial corporation
in each province/territory where business activity occurs.</dd>

<dt>Partnership</dt>

<dd>A partnership is created when two or more
individuals, or two or more corporations, do business together as partners. All
partners share in the profits and the risks or debts of the business. In a
general partnership, each partner is jointly liable for the debts of the
partnership. In a limited partnership, a person can contribute to the business
without being involved in its operations.</dd>

<dt>Sole proprietorship</dt>

<dd>With this type of business organization,
you are the sole owner, and fully responsible for all debts and obligations
related to your business. All profits are yours to keep.</dd>

<dt>Trademark </dt>

<dd>A trademark is a combination of letters,
words, sounds or designs that distinguishes one company’s goods or services
from those of others in the marketplace. By registering your trademark, you
protect it under law from misuse by others, and you gain exclusive rights to
use it throughout Canada for 15 years (a term that you can renew).</dd>
