<p><a href="https://neoinsight.github.io/start-business/mvp/taxes/gsthst/findout-en.html">Find out if you need to charge GST/HST</a>.</p>
<p>If you are charging or planning to charge the GST/HST, you need to register. By registering, you will get a GST/HST number to use when remitting the tax.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a business number, you’ll get it as you register for a GST/HST account.</p>
<section>
<h2>Registering late</h2>
<p>If you have charged the GST/HST on your sales more than 30 days before registering, call <span class="nowrap"><strong>1-800-959-5525</strong></span> for special instructions.</p>
<h2>What you need before you start</h2>
<p>When you register, you need to know your "effective date of registration". Your "effective date of registration" is 29 days after you were required to start charging GST/HST. If you are registering voluntarily, you do not have an "effective date of registration".</p>
<ul>
<li>Find out <a href="https://neoinsight.github.io/start-business/mvp/taxes/gsthst/whentoregister-en.html">when you need to start charging GST/HST</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before registering, you should prepare the following four things:
<div class="wb-tabs">
<div class="tabpanels">
<details id="details-panel1b" open=""><summary>Fiscal year</summary>
<h3>Know your fiscal year</h3>
<p>Every registrant has a fiscal year for GST/HST purposes. We use this fiscal year to determine when your GST/HST returns are due. In most cases, your GST/HST fiscal year is the same as your tax year for income tax purposes.</p>
<p>The tax year of the following business entities is usually a calendar year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>individuals and certain trusts</li>
	<li>professional corporations that are members of a partnership (such as a corporation that is the professional practice of an accountant, a lawyer, or a doctor).</li>
</ul>
<p>A calendar year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. If you have a tax year that is the calendar year, your income tax return covers that&#160;period. If your GST/HST fiscal year is the same as your tax year, your GST/HST fiscal year is also the same.</p>
<p>The income tax fiscal period of a partnership, where at least one member of the partnership is an individual, professional corporation, or other affected partnership, is usually a calendar year. If the GST/HST fiscal year is the same as the income tax fiscal period, then it will also be a calendar year.</p>
<p>The GST/HST fiscal year of a corporation is usually the same as its tax year for income tax purposes.</p>
</details>
<details id="details-panel2b"><summary>Reporting periods</summary>
<h3>Know your reporting period</h3>
<p>When you register for a GST/HST account, we assign you a reporting period. Your annual<strong> total </strong>revenue&#160;generally determines how many times a year you have to file GST/HST returns. You also have the option to file more frequently by making an election.</p>
<p>The following chart shows the assigned reporting periods based on your revenues and the options available.</p>

<ul>
	<li>vary in length throughout your fiscal year; or</li>
	<li>quarter-end and month-end dates do not end on the last day of a calendar month</li>

<p>Although you have to register your business as a single entity, you can apply to have your branches or divisions file their own returns. You may want to keep track of your <strong>GST/HST</strong> accounts separately if your business has any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>more than one location</li>
	<li>more than one business activity (for example, gas station and pizza parlour)</li>
	<li>offices in different provinces</li>
	<li>divisions</li>
	<li>different departments (for example, manufacturing and sales)</li>
</ul>
<p>To qualify to file separately, your branches or divisions have to be separately identified either by their location or the nature of their activities. They must also keep separate records. The branches and divisions have to keep the same reporting periods as the parent company.</p>

<p>Generally, when one unincorporated organization (such as a club or association) is a member of an unincorporated main organization, but is a separate entity, the organizations have to charge the GST/HST on taxable transactions between them, if they are GST/HST registrants. However, such organizations can apply jointly to have the member organization considered a branch of the main organization.</p>

If the application is approved, the GST/HST will not apply to transfers of goods and services between the member organization and the main organization.</p>
<p>When two unincorporated organizations are members of the same unincorporated main organization and each member applies jointly with the main organization, using Form GST32 and both of their applications are approved, the GST/HST will not apply to taxable transactions between the two member organizations.&#160;&#160;</p>
